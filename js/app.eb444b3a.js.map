One morning, when\n                Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself\n                transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\n                armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could\n                see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into\n                stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and\n                seemed ready to slide off any moment.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </md-card-content>\n      </md-card>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {};\n</script>\n<style scoped>\n.text-center {\n  display: flex;\n}\ncode {\n  font-size: 87.5%;\n  color: #e91e63;\n  word-break: break-word;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=template&id=08c2e8ea&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./GridSystem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=08c2e8ea&scoped=true&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"08c2e8ea\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"md-layout\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"md-layout-item md-size-30 md-medium-size-100\"},[_c('tabs',{attrs:{\"tab-name\":['Year 1', 'Year 3', 'Year 5'],\"color-button\":\"warning\"}},[_c('h4',{staticClass:\"title\",attrs:{\"slot\":\"header-title\"},slot:\"header-title\"},[_vm._v(\"\\n        ANNUAL FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHT \\n      \")]),_c('template',{slot:\"tab-pane-1\"},[_c('table',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"200%\"}},[_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expected Rent\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$17,955\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expenses\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$4,040\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Property Taxes\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$5,900\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Loan Payments\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$0\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('hr',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"130%\"}})]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Net Cash Flow\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$8,015\")])])])]),_c('template',{slot:\"tab-pane-2\"},[_c('table',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"200%\"}},[_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expected Rent\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$19,048\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expenses\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$4,298\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Property Taxes\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$6,354\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Loan Payments\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$0\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('hr',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"130%\"}})]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Net Cash Flow\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$8,397\")])])])]),_c('template',{slot:\"tab-pane-3\"},[_c('table',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"200%\"}},[_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expected Rent\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$20,209\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Expenses\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$4,574\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Property Taxes\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"-$6,842\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Loan Payments\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$0\")])]),_c('tr',[_c('hr',{staticStyle:{\"width\":\"130%\"}})]),_c('tr',[_c('td',[_vm._v(\"Net Cash Flow\")]),_c('td',[_vm._v(\"$8,793\")])])])])],2)],1),_c('div',{staticClass:\"md-layout-item md-size-50 md-medium-size-100\"},[_c('tabs',{attrs:{\"tab-name\":['Profile', 'Settings', 'Options'],\"color-button\":\"warning\"}},[_c('h4',{staticClass:\"title\",attrs:{\"slot\":\"header-title\"},slot:\"header-title\"},[_vm._v(\"\\n        Navigation Pills - \"),_c('small',{staticClass:\"description\"},[_vm._v(\"Horizontal Tabs\")])]),_c('template',{slot:\"tab-pane-1\"},[_vm._v(\"\\n        Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play\\n        networks.
